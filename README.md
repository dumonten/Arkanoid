# Arkanoid 

As part of my laboratory work, I developed this game with the goal of acquiring proficiency in the C++ 
language and gaining a foundational understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. 
To handle the graphical aspects of the game, I utilized the SFML library.

# Completed Tasks 

The game I created is Arkanoid, a classic arcade game. In addition to the core gameplay mechanics, 
I implemented a bonus system that relies on timers. Furthermore, 
I incorporated serialization functionality manually, allowing the game to save the player's progress. 
This saved data can then be loaded from within the game menu, providing a seamless user experience.
